Key prompts given to AI tools while building ShromikAI, and what they produced. Updated at the end of each phase.

## 2026-11-09 — Planning

- **Prompt (to Claude):** Read the event guide and judging criteria; recommend the best challenge and a full project plan we can build with Claude's help.
- **Result:** Chose JusticeSphere AI → Legal Copilot. Project plan with five core features, verified-citation architecture, evaluation plan and judging-criteria mapping.
- **Prompt (to ChatGPT):** Review Claude's plan critically.
- **Result:** Kept scope to one use case (employment contracts), added test-case structure, abstention rule, law-version handling. MCP moved to the final round.

## 2026-11-10 — Phase 1: Foundation

- **Prompt (to Claude):** Set up the repository with a Gradle + YAML Spring Boot backend and a React + TypeScript frontend.
